# Privacy Policy

For an obvious reason, this app loads the website from discord. Therefore, please read Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy). I myself am not the one creating this terms but because the app mainly put Discord on the WebView you will use Discord's service.

I myself curerntly do not collect and upload any user data to the internet. However, Microsoft Store might collect some information for analytic report or debugging information and for this you should go ahead and look at their privacy policy to see what they collected.
